## Netconf for ATOM

This package provides a simplistic graphical user-interface for learning and
testing the NETCONF protocol. This software contains a NETCONF client, which
runs against a NETCONF server, such as NOKIA 7750 Service Routers.

In the current implementation this NETCONF client is using NETCONF over
SSHv2 with either password or key-based authentication as described in
[RFC 6242](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6242).

Both base:1.0 *end-of-message framing* and base:1.1 *chunked-framing* are
both supported. Authentication supports username with password or
certificate.

To use this package, it is required to specify connection details in the
package settings. All features are accessible from toolbars which are added
to the ATOM statusbar. A limited feature-set is accessible from the ATOM
menubar and context menus.

If you need to deal with multiple NETCONF servers, connection details can be
specified in a YAML file called server.yaml. This will add a selection list
of servers to the toolbar.
