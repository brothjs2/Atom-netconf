  "readme": "## Netconf for ATOM\n\nThis package provides a simplistic graphical user-interface for learning and\ntesting the NETCONF protocol. This software contains a NETCONF client, which\nruns against a NETCONF server, such as NOKIA 7750 Service Routers.\n\nIn the current implementation this NETCONF client is using NETCONF over\nSSHv2 with either password or key-based authentication as described in\n[RFC 6242](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6242).\n\nBoth base:1.0 *end-of-message framing* and base:1.1 *chunked-framing* are\nboth supported. Authentication supports username with password or\ncertificate.\n\n![Netconf Package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nokia/atom-netconf/master/screenshot.png)\n\nTo use this package, it is required to specify connection details in the\npackage settings. All features are accessible from toolbars which are added\nto the ATOM statusbar. A limited feature-set is accessible from the ATOM\nmenubar and context menus.\n\nIf you need to deal with multiple NETCONF servers, connection details can be\nspecified in a YAML file called server.yaml. This will add a selection list\nof servers to the toolbar.\n\n**Copyright (c) 2016-2018**  \n![NOKIA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nokia/atom-netconf/master/logo-tiny.png)\n",
